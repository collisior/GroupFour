### Technology stack

For the front end the markup language is HTML, and to make it more vibrant looking and having some interactive background features CSS stylesheets is also used.

For the back end runs on Python programming language with Flask Web framework, and SQLAlchemy database. I considered to use Ruby, but once I started it was a little more complicated to connect it with front end than with Python. In Flask it is not  complicated to access the data from database, calling functions, user authentication, and passing tokens. Working with SQLALchemy is such a pleasure, because SQLAlchemy contains object relaitonal mapper for SQL databases. Considering to work with MongoDB, SQLAlchemy was faster to learn and get comfortable with considering our web application's needs.
