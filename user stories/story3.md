## Understanding songs in foreign languages

Fetty likes listening to Spotify songs in English, but he isn’t fluent enough in English to understand what all of the lyrics mean. Whenever he wants to know what the song he is listening to means, he logs into our application with his Spotify account. In our application, he is able to see the lyrics of the song he is listening to in the song’s native language in addition to another language of his choice at the same time. This allows him to easily learn the meaning of the songs he is listening to. Because our translations are not verified by a fluent speaker in that language, they may sometimes be inaccurate. When Fetty finds inaccurate lyrics for a song, he can click a button to notify us. If enough users mark a song’s translation as inaccurate, our application will display a warning that the translation may be inaccurate for that song.
