## Lyrics memorization - visual learning
Lucy is a high school student, and she wants to sing her favorite song in a talent show. She found the lyrics for the song on Google, but since Lucy is a visual learner, it is difficult for her to memorize lyrics for the song by just reading the text. Then she logs into our application using her Spotify account and plays her Liked songs. Once she starts to play a song, the website provides lyrics synchronized with corresponding images, which would result in easier lyric memorization. Suppose Lucy clicked on the wrong song and explicit lyrics were displayed, the images of the explicit lyrics would be muted (explicit content warning) to ensure the application is safe for all ages.
