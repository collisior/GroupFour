## Looking up lyrics is time/tab consuming

Gabby is an investment banker who is always busy and rarely has any time to spare. When doing her daily work tasks, she likes to listen to music and sing along to ease her stress level. However, some of the songs she likes listening to have lyrics that are very difficult to understand. If she were to look up the lyrics on Google, she would have to scroll through the entire song to find where in the song she is, and she simply doesn’t have that kind of time. With our application, she is prompted to log in with her Spotify account and is able to play any song of her choosing and instantly see what the lyrics are for the verse she is currently listening to. If Gabby has to log in to our application and type in her username and password every time, she wouldn’t end up saving much time compared to searching for the lyrics on Google. In order to fix this, our application caches her user credentials from her computer to speed up access.
