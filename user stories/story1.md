## Tired of skipping every other song...

Gabby is a hardworking student who is commuting to school every morning and while commuting she listening to music. She doesn’t have time every day to set up a perfect playlist. The mood is different every day, so the song playlist preference is also different. However, playing her songs on “Shuffle” results in too much song skipping - she is tired of skipping almost every other song to fit her current mood. With our application, she is prompted to log in with her Spotify account and then forward to the page where she is going be able to take a selfie or rate her mood on a scale of 0-100 (saddest - happiest). Once she submitted her selfie or mood-rate, she will find a generated playlist based on her mood in her Spotify account ready to enjoy during her long commutes!
